# easyOrder

A project I did at university with three other people. It was made only for learning purpose.

This tool should make the ordering process of a restaurant/bar easier. In a real life scenario, the application is running on tablets. Every table has a tablet to take the orders from the customers, the waiters have a tablet and there are also tablets in the kitchen.

There are three different interfaces for every usecase.
Customer: The customers are able to make an order or call for help.
Waiter: The waiter sees all new orders and can organise them in different ways. E.g. send an order to the kitchen.
Kitchen: The kitches sees all the orders which are ready to cook and can also organise them. E.g. mark them ready to serve.

The whole programm is simplified and some essential things, like the payment process, are missing.
